Logic Scripts > Engine Kernel + Core > Library Modules.

Logic Scripts drive everything and are reliant upon the combination of the Engine Kernel and a Core.
The Core defines the Script Interpretor - Lua, Python, whatever.
Library Modules rely on a Core being loaded, and can check the type and version number during their bootstrap to decide whether they can, or will, bind.

All Core Modules must derive from SGECORE.
All Library Modules must derive from SGELIB, and take an SGECORE during their bootstrap.

Modules may support multiple COREs if they wish, but must do their checking in the bootstrap, and bind as appropriate.
Yes, this involves static casting to the correct CORE, and therefore a dependency is formed upon that version of the CORE.
This is why there's version and name checking available to ensure you have the right one!

Modules may do whatever they want in C/C++ and bind whatever they want to script.
