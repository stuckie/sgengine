# sgengine
SGEngine - An aborted attempt at an engine using dynamically loaded libraries.

I started this engine after Ludum Dare 17 ( Yargh! ) with the intention of replacing SGZEngine, which was getting a bit long in the tooth, and I was spending a lot of time patching out functionality to Lua.
I then came about with the idea of dynamically loading chunks of code in and out at runtime, to the point that I did have an SDL, OpenGL and DirectX renderer being dynamically shunted in and out at runtime with this framework.
Sadly, this is all I have left.. gleamed from an old SVN repository up on xp-dev.. while it compiles under Linux via CodeLite, it won't run.. I don't have any config information for it, nor examples.

Shame really.. as I might've done something interesting with it.

Other than the tiny Component-based engine I did for TITAN ( Ludum Dare 18 ) this was the last engine I sat down and wrote before starting GLESGAE a long time later.
